In this chapter, we will take a journey through the rich history of artificial intelligence (AI), tracing its evolution from the early concepts and pioneers to the contemporary applications that are shaping the future of healthcare.

**1. The Birth of AI**
----------------------

The origins of AI can be traced back to the mid-20th century when researchers began to explore the idea of creating machines capable of intelligent behavior. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop, led by John McCarthy, is often regarded as the birth of AI as a field of study. The workshop laid the foundation for AI research by defining its goals and challenges.

**2. Early AI Concepts**
------------------------

Early AI research focused on symbolic AI, which aimed to replicate human intelligence through the manipulation of symbols and rules. Researchers developed programs that could perform logical reasoning and solve mathematical problems. Notable early AI projects included the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver.

**3. The AI Winter**
--------------------

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of what is known as the "AI winter." Funding and interest in AI research declined due to unrealized expectations and limited computational power. Many believed that AI had hit insurmountable roadblocks.
