Artificial intelligence (AI) is already transforming the healthcare industry, with a range of applications being used today. From predictive analytics to robotic surgery, AI is being used to improve patient outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, and support personalized medicine. In this chapter, we will explore the current state of AI in healthcare, including examples of AI applications and trends in AI adoption.

Examples of AI Applications Today
---------------------------------

### Predictive Analytics

AI is being increasingly used for predictive analytics, helping healthcare providers to predict patient risk and develop more targeted interventions. For example, AI systems are being used to predict which patients are most at risk of developing sepsis, a condition that can be fatal if not treated quickly. By analyzing data such as vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical notes, these systems can identify patients who are most at risk and alert healthcare providers to the need for immediate intervention.

### Robotics

AI-powered robots are already being used in a range of medical settings, from surgical procedures to patient care. For example, the da Vinci surgical system is a robotic system that allows surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries with greater precision and control. Meanwhile, robotic patient care assistants are being used to provide mobility assistance and support for patients with disabilities or chronic conditions.

### Diagnosis and Treatment Support

AI is being used to support healthcare providers with diagnosis and treatment decisions, providing greater accuracy and efficiency. For example, AI systems are being used to analyze medical imaging data, such as CT scans and MRIs, to identify potential abnormalities and suggest treatment options. This can help to reduce the workload on human radiologists and improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans.

Trends in AI Adoption in Healthcare
-----------------------------------

### Increased Investment

There has been a significant increase in investment in AI in healthcare, with many healthcare organizations and technology companies investing in the development of AI-powered systems. According to a report by Accenture, the total funding for AI healthcare startups reached $1.6 billion in 2020, with investment expected to continue to grow.

### Growing Acceptance Among Healthcare Providers

As AI technologies become more advanced and widely adopted, there is growing acceptance among healthcare providers. A survey by Intel found that 84% of healthcare providers believe that AI will be able to automate administrative tasks and support clinical decision-making in the near future.

### Focus on Patient-Centered Care

AI is being used to support patient-centered care, with a greater focus on personalized medicine and individualized treatment plans. By analyzing patient data, including genetic and environmental factors, AI systems can identify potential risks and suggest tailored interventions that are specific to each individual patient's needs.

Conclusion
----------

The current state of AI in healthcare is already transforming the industry, with a range of applications being used today to improve patient outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, and support personalized medicine. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more widely adopted, it is likely that we will see even more innovative uses of AI in healthcare delivery, management, and research.
